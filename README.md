## Project Name
**Sportify**
## Project Description
Finding individuals or groups with similar sports interests and organizing events can be challenging, especially for those new to a city or seeking partners with specific skill levels. Traditional methods of connecting, such as word of mouth or social media, are often inefficient and lack tailored options for event management. This gap leads to missed opportunities for engagement, limited access to recreational or competitive activities, and reduced motivation to stay active. The lack of a centralized platform that combines event creation, user matching, and seamless communication highlights the need for a solution to bring sports enthusiasts together efficiently and effectively.

Sportify is a web-based platform designed to connect individuals with similar sports interests, making it easier for people to engage in recreational or competitive activities. Users can create and join sports events in their area, customize event details like location, time and interact with others through integrated chat features. The platform includes user profiles for event browsing and location-based filtering to find nearby events. By fostering an active community, the platform encourages social connections and healthy lifestyles while providing an intuitive interface for seamless event management and communication among sports enthusiasts.
